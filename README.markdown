# eMCUlator - Emulate a MCU (microcontroller)

This program is able to interpret most ARM Cortex-M0 instructions. It takes a
binary as input and executes it. It currently only supports the NRF51822 (flash,
memory map, UART peripheral).

While most of it works, some emulation does not. This is a work-in-progress, and
I won't promise I'll ever finish it.
